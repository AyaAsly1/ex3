SpongeBob The Absorbent Square
SpongeBob is the most absorbent square you'll ever meet! Originally hailing from a pineapple under the sea in Bikini Bottom, he communicates in perfect gibberish (though everyone understands him somehow). SpongeBob loves his job as a fry cook at the Krusty Krab, and his infectious enthusiasm is legendary. Just like any true Bikini Bottom resident, he can't resist a delicious Krabby Patty!
